BasicMata

BasicMata is A very simple way to interface an arduino over serial protocol from any computer. It's based on the Idea of Firmata (http://firmata.org/wiki/Main_Page) but won't allow you to change any setting. Therfore the Code is as simple as possible and should run on all Arduinos with similar pins (most important are the PWM outputs Pins see Pinouts)! It's thought for people who just want to get going as fast as possible,without the need and possibility to configure anything from outside the Arduino IDE.
